# Google Search Results Clone

## Objective

To create a clone of the Google Search Results page using HTML and CSS.

#### Specifications

##### Main

1. Don't be a perfectionist
 * The page is just supposed to look like Google's page, not function like it
 * Spacing just needs to *similar*, not down to the pixel.
 * Dropdown menus, form submissions, and hover-highlighting should be ignored
2. Do as much as you can before viewing the page's source code or relying on Dev Tools
3. When complete, project should be pushed to GitHub. Git should be used for Version Control.

##### Optional:
4. Submit a pull request to contribute this solution to The Odin Project.

##### Ambiguous:
5. Should the project be mobile responsive?

#### Learning Objectives

This project is designed to facilitate practice towards mastery of HTML and CSS. In addition, it allows for practice creating and modifying a Version Control project with Git and GitHub. This is the "hard" version of the project.

## Author's notes

#### Preliminary Thoughts

I am already very comfortable with HTML and CSS, so this is mostly review. However, I haven't used a lot of CSS Grid since taking [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) [Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) course nor CSS Flexbox since completing [Dave Geddes'](https://twitter.com/geddski) [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies) Flexbox gamification. In addition, I could definitely use some practice with icons. I have learned a lot about debugging with Dev Tools in [Wes Bos'](https://wesbos.com/) [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course so it will be good to apply that knowledge in a genuine setting. Lastly, I will make the page mobile responsive even though I don't think it's a requirement, because that is a valuable thing to practice and that's really the whole point here.

#### Final Thoughts

To be filled out upon project completion.
